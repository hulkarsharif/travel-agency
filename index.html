                <h2>What do you know about Turkey</h2>
            </div>

            <p class="hero-section__description">
                <strong>Turkey</strong> is located in southeastern Europe and
                southwestern Asia (that portion of Turkey west of the Bosporus
                is geographically part of Europe), bordering the
                <strong>Black Se</strong>a, between
                <strong>Bulgaria and Georgia</strong>, and bordering the
                <strong>Aegan Sea</strong> and the
                <strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong> , between Greece and
                Syria.<br />
                Most of the Turkish landmass is in Asia and is known as Anatolia
                and 3% is in Europe and known as Thrace. Surrounded by six major
                bodies of water, Turkey has 8,000 km of coastline (from north to
                south: the Black Sea, Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus, the strait
                of the Dardanelles, the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas). Turkey
                borders Armenia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Greece, Syria and Iraq. The
                highest point in Turkey is Mount Ararat at 5,166 meters and the
                source of both the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is in Turkey.<br />
                Turkey is a secular, democratic state governed by the rule of
                law; committed to the nationalism of its founding father Ataturk
                and based on the principle of the separation of powers.<br />
                The leather processing industry is also very developed. While
                99% of the population of the population is Muslim, Turkey is a
                secular state that guarantees complete freedom of worship to
                non-Muslims.
