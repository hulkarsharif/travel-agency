                <h2>What do you know about Turkey</h2>
                <p class="hero-section__description">
                    Turkey is located in southeastern Europe and southwestern
                    Asia (that portion of Turkey west of the Bosporus is
                    geographically part of Europe), bordering the Black Sea,
                    between Bulgaria and Georgia, and bordering the Aegean Sea
                    and the Mediterranean Sea, between Greece and Syria. Most of
                    the Turkish landmass is in Asia and is known as Anatolia and
                    3% is in Europe and known as Thrace. Surrounded by six major
                    bodies of water, Turkey has 8,000 km of coastline (from
                    north to south: the Black Sea, Sea of Marmara, the
                    Bosphorus, the strait of the Dardanelles, the Aegean and
                    Mediterranean Seas). Turkey borders Armenia, Georgia,
                    Bulgaria, Greece, Syria and Iraq. The highest point in
                    Turkey is Mount Ararat at 5,166 meters and the source of
                    both the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is in Turkey. Turkey is
                    a secular, democratic state governed by the rule of law;
                    committed to the nationalism of its founding father AtatuÂ¸rk
                    and based on the principle of the separation of powers. The
                    executive power is in the hands of the president and the
                    Council of Ministers, the legislative body is the Grand
                    National Assembly, and the judicial branch is made up of
                    independent, supreme and judiciary courts. Turkey is a world
                    leader in the production of hard-shell nuts (especially
                    hazelnuts), figs, apricots, vegetables, grapes, tobacco,
                    wheat and cotton and is among the leading countries in
                    textiles and ready-to-wear clothing production. The leather
                    processing industry is also very developed. While 99% of the
                    population of the population is Muslim, Turkey is a secular
                    state that guarantees complete freedom of worship to
                    non-Muslims.
